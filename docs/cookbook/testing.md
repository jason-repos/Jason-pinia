# Testing stores

:::warning
This code is still not released.
::::

Stores will, by design, be used at many places and can make testing much harder than it should be. Fortunately, this doesn't have to be the case. We need to take care of three things when testing stores:

- The `pinia` instance: Stores cannot work without it
- `actions`: most of the time, they contain the most complex logic of our stores. Wouldn't it be nice if they were mocked by default?
- Plugins: If you rely on plugins, you will have to install them for tests too

Depending on what or how you are testing, we need to take care of these three differently:

- [Unit testing stores (outside of components)](#unit-testing-a-store)
- [Unit testing components that use stores](#unit-testing-components)
- [End to End tests](#e2e-tests)

## Unit testing a store

To unit test a store, the most important part is creating a `pinia` instance:

```js
// counterStore.spec.ts
import { setActivePinia, createPinia } from 'pinia'
import { useCounter } from '../src/stores/counter'

describe('Counter Store', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    // creates a fresh pinia and make it active so it's automatically picked
    // up by any useStore() call without having to pass it to it:
    // `useStore(pinia)`
    setActivePinia(createPinia())
  })

  it('increments', () => {
    const counter = useCounter()
    expect(counter.n).toBe(0)
    counter.increment()
    expect(counter.n).toBe(1)
  })

  it('increments by amount', () => {
    const counter = useCounter()
    counter.increment(10)
    expect(counter.n).toBe(10)
  })
})
```

If you have any store plugins, there is one important thing to know: **plugins won't be used until `pinia` is installed in an App**. This can be solved by creating an empty App or a fake one:

```js
import { setActivePinia, createPinia } from 'pinia'
import { createApp } from 'vue'
import { somePlugin } from '../src/stores/plugin'

// same code as above...

// you don't need to create one app per test
const app = createApp({})
beforeEach(() => {
  const pinia = createPinia().use(somePlugin)
  app.use(pinia)
  setActivePinia(pinia)
})
```

## Unit testing components

Coming soon with `createTestingPinia()`... But if you are adventurous and want to give it a try, check the [existing tests for it](https://github.com/posva/pinia/blob/v2/__tests__/testing.spec.ts#L36). Note in future releases, you will have to install `@pinia/testing` (which doesn't exist yet) and adapt the imports. Make sure to keep an eye on releases to be notified when this happen!

## E2E tests

When it comes to pinia, you don't need to change anything for e2e tests, that's the whole point of e2e tests! You could maybe tests HTTP requests, but that's way beyond the scope of this guide ðŸ˜„.
