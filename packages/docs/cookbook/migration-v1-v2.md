# Migrating from 0.x (v1) to v2

Starting at version `2.0.0-rc.4`, pinia supports both Vue 2 and Vue 3! This means, all new updates will be applied to this version 2 so both Vue 2 and Vue 3 users can benefit from it. If you are using Vue 3, this doesn't change anything for you as you were already using the rc and you can check [the CHANGELOG](https://github.com/posva/pinia/blob/v2/packages/pinia/CHANGELOG.md) for detailed explanation of everything that changed. Otherwise, **this guide is for you**!

## Deprecations

Let's take a look at all the changes you need to apply to your code. First, make sure you are already running the latest 0.x version to see any deprecations:

```shell
npm i 'pinia@^0.x.x'
# or with yarn
yarn add 'pinia@^0.x.x'
```

If you are using ESLint, consider using [this plugin](https://github.com/gund/eslint-plugin-deprecation) to find all deprecated usages. Otherwise, you should be able to see them as they appear crossed. These are the APIs that were deprecated that were removed:

- `createStore()` becomes `defineStore()`
- In subscriptions, `storeName` becomes `storeId`

## Breaking changes

After removing these, you can upgrade to v2 with:

```shell
npm i 'pinia@^2.x.x'
# or with yarn
yarn add 'pinia@^2.x.x'
```

And start updating your code

### Generic Store type

Added in [2.0.0-rc.0](https://github.com/posva/pinia/blob/v2/packages/pinia/CHANGELOG.md#200-rc0-2021-07-28)

Replace any usage of the type `GenericStore` with `StoreGeneric`. This is the new generic store type that should accept any kind of store. If you were writing functions using the type `Store` without passing its generics (e.g. `Store<Id, State, Getters, Actions>`), you should also use `StoreGeneric` as the `Store` type without generics creates an empty store type.

```diff
-function takeAnyStore(store: Store) {}
+function takeAnyStore(store: StoreGeneric) {}

-function takeAnyStore(store: GenericStore) {}
+function takeAnyStore(store: StoreGeneric) {}
```

## `DefineStoreOptions` for plugins

If you were writing plugins, using TypeScript, and extending the type `DefineStoreOptions` to add custom options, you should rename it to `DefineStoreOptionsBase`. This type will apply to both setup and options stores.

```diff
 declare module 'pinia' {
-  export interface DefineStoreOptions<S, Store> {
+  export interface DefineStoreOptionsBase<S, Store> {
     debounce?: {
       [k in keyof A]?: number
     }
   }
 }
```

## `@vue/composition-api` version

Since pinia now relies on `effectScope()`, you must use at least the version `1.1.0` of `@vue/composition-api`:

```shell
npm i @vue/composition-api@latest
# or with yarn
yarn add @vue/composition-api@latest
```

## Devtools

Pinia v2 no longer hijacks Vue Devtools v5, it requires Vue Devtools v6. Find the download link on the [Vue Devtools documentation](https://devtools.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html#chrome) for the **beta channel** of the extension.
